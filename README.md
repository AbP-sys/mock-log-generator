# Mock log generator
An application to generate logs of specific use cases for log analysis using machine learning. 

## Purpose 
This application is to simulate specific use cases of real-life traffic which can be fed into an ML model for training and testing purposes to detect anomalies in server, configuration, or user traffic and suggest appropriate counter measures.

The main focus of this application is to instantaneously generate logs which might occur over a long period of time in real-life. 

For example: 

- Authentication error for same user for 10 times in 2 days.
- Increasing trend in CPU usage.
 
## Preview

log.txt:
Relevant logs for user authentication failure have been highlighted with 'ðŸ”´'
